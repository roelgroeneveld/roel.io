Very interesting article by Rob Rhyne on [one of the main characters in The Expanse and Back Burner thinking](http://rd2.io/2017/05/background-thinking/):

> I rely on my sub-conscious brain to churn through what I observe, and process everything into a cohesive picture. The shower, the dinner table, and the car are most often the places where an idea will surface that pulls everything together for me. At times I’ll gaze into the distance. Other times, I need a monotonous task which requires only a little attention.

> An early manager—who really understands engineers—used to tell me I was a “burst worker”. That is, I would sit on a problem, and think it completely through. Then I’d open a text editor and dash out a solution in an afternoon. The process was neither slower, or faster, than my fellow engineers. But unless you observed an entire cycle, I would either appear a procrastinator, or a 10x engineer.

It took me years to figure out (some of) the different types of people in my surroundings. And how every one of them thinks, works and reacts in a different way.
