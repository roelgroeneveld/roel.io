Good news from [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/16/scientists-accidentally-create-mutant-enzyme-that-eats-plastic-bottles):

> Scientists have created a mutant enzyme that breaks down plastic drinks bottles â€“ by accident. The breakthrough could help solve the global plastic pollution crisis by enabling for the first time the full recycling of bottles.
