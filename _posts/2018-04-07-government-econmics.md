 [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2018/04/exit-voice-and-loyalty.html):

> We often have a choice: speak up or leave. In commerce, if we don't like a brand, we leave. (..) 
Sometimes, instead of leaving, people speak up.

He touches upon an important distinction:

>For most of my life, the biggest separation between government and economics was this distinction.
In many cases, government has generally taken the idea of exit off the table.
