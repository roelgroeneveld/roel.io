[Interesting observation from Om Malik on how time (measurement) changed our society](https://om.co/2018/08/02/time-is-on-apples-side/):

> About a century ago there was a disagreement between philosopher Henri Bergson and physicist Albert Einstein on what is time. If the philosopher delved into the subjectivity of time, while the eminent scientist was all about objective reality of time. Einstein’s idea of time would be what the clock measures and Bergson’s argument is why do we need a clock. Why indeed?

> Lewis Mumford, a New York City-based historian once argued that “clock, not the steam engine or the printing press as the ‘key machine of industrial modern age.’” The idea of minutes and seconds has defined the workplace and so much of our society.

Now the Gig Economy and wearables may again affect our idea of what time is:

> For example, as gig economies become more pervasive, the idea of what constitutes a “job” is becoming more fluid. You don’t have shifts, instead you have notifications you swipe on to determine if you are going to take a rider somewhere or not. The farms, factories and offices are being replaced by a new notion of workspace. We don’t know what it is — and with robotics and automation, what it will be in the future. It won’t be what it was — that is for certain.
