Just started learning about how to use [the CSS BEM methodology](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/06/bem-for-beginners/). It will take some getting used to, but will definitely make CSS better maintainable, I think.

Now what to do with all these other methodologies: OOCSS, SMACSS
BassCSS, RSCSS? It seems like everybody likes something different. Nice... ;-)
