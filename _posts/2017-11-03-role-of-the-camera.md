“[A camera can serve as a passport to other lives and cultures](https://www.instagram.com/p/BbCSTX7BDjE/) but it also paradoxically stands between the photographer and the world. ‘We’re not participating, we’re observing,’ Miller says. ‘We’re trying to be inconspicuous; we’re trying to be “not there,” but there. So it’s a pretty lonely life.’”
