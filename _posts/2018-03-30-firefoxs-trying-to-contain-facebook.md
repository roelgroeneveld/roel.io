As a decade long Firefox user, I will be watching this with interest: 

[Mozilla](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/03/27/facebook-container-add-on/): _"We made a new add-on for Firefox called [Facebook Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container/) in response to the growing demand we see for tools that help manage privacy and security."_ 

The [source code](https://github.com/mozilla/contain-facebook) is available on Github.
