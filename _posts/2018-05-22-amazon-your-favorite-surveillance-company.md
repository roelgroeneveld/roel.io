Amazon is now also [officially in the surveillance business](https://www.aclunc.org/blog/amazon-teams-law-enforcement-deploy-dangerous-new-face-recognition-technology): 

> The company has developed a powerful and dangerous new facial recognition system and is actively helping governments deploy it. Amazon calls the service “Rekognition.

> Marketing materials and documents obtained by ACLU affiliates in three states reveal a product that can be readily used to violate civil liberties and civil rights. Powered by artificial intelligence, Rekognition can identify, track, and analyze people in real time and recognize up to 100 people in a single image. It can quickly scan information it collects against databases featuring tens of millions of faces, according to Amazon. 

[@BenedictEvans](https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans) used to say that all software expands until it includes messaging. In the same vein: every large cloud computing provider eventually becomes a surveillance provider. 

Isn’t the cloud lovely? ☁️
