I _finally_ read the New Yorker article on Susan Kare, '[The Woman Who Gave the Macintosh a Smile](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-woman-who-gave-the-macintosh-a-smile)'. And loved this detail about the Command icon on every Mac keyboard: 

> The command icon, still right there to the left of your space bar, was based on a Swedish campground sign meaning “interesting feature,” pulled from a book of historical symbols. 

The hardest icons were actions that didn't have a real world equivalent, like **Undo**. And what about the **Copy** icon?   

> At one point, there was to be an icon of a copy machine for making a copy of a file, and users would drag and drop a file onto it to copy it, but it was difficult to render a copier at that scale. Kare also tried a cat in a mirror, for copycat. Neither made the cut.
