Als sociaal werker leerde Wilneida Negron dat ze kwetsbare mensen kon helpen door contact te leggen met andere experts en bruggen te bouwen. Ook met technologie, want:

> when applied in ways that serves the public interest – like helping to connect vulnerable communities to vital information and resources, and building movements – technology could be one of those bridges.

## Negatieve
Steeds meer mensen zich realiseren dat onze moderne technologie, van smartphone tot het surveillance-kapitalisme van Facebook en Google, veel negatieve effecten heeft. Maar er zijn dus ook lichtpuntjes. [Technology for Good](https://www.fastcompany.com/90270299/want-to-build-tech-for-good-understand-peoples-needs-first), zeg maar. Niet volgens het "move fast and break things" ethos van Silicon Valley, want dat versterkt juist hoe bestaande sociale, economische en politieke structuren. Twee voorbeelden: 

> [a] loophole in Facebook’s API allowed law enforcement to monitor the social media accounts of young men of color I counseled after they were released from detention, and without their knowledge. (After pressure from advocates, Facebook fixed this glaring privacy problem in 2016.) And how the low-income families I was assisting, already dealing with limited broadband access, were plagued by online ads for predatory loans whenever they tried to search for information online. For these youth of color and low-income families, their experience of technology and the internet was already being shaped by their race, gender, and socioeconomic backgrounds.

We are at the cusp of a new wave of technological thinking, one defined by a new mantra that is the opposite of Zuckerberg’s: “Move carefully and purposely, and embrace complexity.” As part of this wave, a new, inclusive, and intersectional generation of people are using technology for the public interest. This new wave will help us prepare for a future where technical expertise coexists with empathy, humility, and perseverance.
