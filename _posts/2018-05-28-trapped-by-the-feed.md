Om Malik [hits it on head](https://om.co/2018/05/26/we-are-all-trapped-in-the-feed/):

> No matter where I go on the Internet, I feel like I am trapped in the “feed,” held down by algorithms that are like axes trying to make bespoke shirts out of silk.

YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, they are all about the lowest common denominator. There is no real personalized value we receive from providing our data, we are just data sources for the popularity contests.
